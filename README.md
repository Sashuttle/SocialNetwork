# SocialNetwork
The purpose of Challenge 18 for the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp is to practice building a mock up API for a social network web application.  Users will be able to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friends list.  This will demonstrate my ability to use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and use Mongoose ODM.
